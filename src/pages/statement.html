      <h3>The Creative Process - How I Work</h3>

      <div class="row row-collapse">
        <div class="small-12 medium-12 large-6 columns">
          <p>I enjoy the challenge of allowing the painting to unfold and intuition to guide me. Most of my paintings do not have a fixed definite outcome at the start. This process of creating, transforms my relationship with the subject and I hope will help others too.</p>

      <p>In making, each image develops as an icon, the subject and scene develop together in a transformational process. I work in a range of media, chosen to suit the subject matter. For example the original Blue Whale painting is a watercolour, however, the majority of my work is painted in mixed media and finished in oils.</p>
