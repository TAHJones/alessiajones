      <p>I enjoy the challenge of allowing the painting to unfold and intuition to guide me. Most of my paintings do not have a fixed definite outcome at the start. This process of creating, transforms my relationship with the subject and I hope will help others too. In making, each image develops as an icon, the subject and scene develop together in a transformational process.</p>

      <p>I work in a range of media, chosen to suit the subject matter. For example the original Blue Whale painting is a watercolour, however, the majority of my work is painted in mixed media and finished in oils.</p> 

      <p>In this website, you will find my artwork organised into groups. My Current Collection and Early Work, all original Early Works have been sold, however, high quality archival prints are available on request. Early Works prints are sold in size of their original corresponding painting (see individual artworks details).</p>

      <p>My Current Collection is a series created for print, a few original paintings are available, as shown in details under each image. Reproductions are sold as limited edition Fine Art Prints. These are produced as Giclâ€še Archival quality prints, each print varies in price according to size. See pricelist attached for details. Please feel free to send me a message using the contact form. </p>
