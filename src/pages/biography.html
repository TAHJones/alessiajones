    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>Hello, welcome to my website, my name is Alessia Jones and this page is designed to tell you about my professional career as an artist.</p>

    <h3>Penzance School of Art</h3>
    
    <p>I studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, London, graduating in 2002. Following a year travelling, I moved to Cornwall to draw inspiration from the beautiful coast with its dramatic light and powerful seascapes. I set up my first studio there (in the same building as Anthony Frost!) and began my journey as professional painter.</p>

        <p>In 2005, I was employed by Penwith and Truro College as lecturer, to teach Painting and Drawing, at the Penzance School of Art. I ran popular courses on Coastal and Still Life Abstraction, Portraiture and Life Drawing. My expertise in painting from life is well grounded in a tradition of painting taught at the Slade, where one of my most influential teachers Mark Dunford studied. It was a great joy for me to share my passion for painting with other budding artists and I realised that teaching is also an integral part of my vocation.</p>

    <p>I was excited to be teaching at The Penzance School of Art, as it has a rich history, having produced some of the finest artists in its time. Lead by Stanhope Forbes and Frank Bramley, who set up the Newlyn School. I was inspired by the Art in Cornwall, the work of famous artists; Sir Terry Frost, Dame Barbara Hepworth, Winifred Nicholson and Dod Procter. I learnt a lot from other Cornish and contemporary painters; Rose Hilton, Catheryne Hyde and Kurt Jackson.</p>

    <h3>The Blakeists</h3>

    <p>My dedicated students and I formed and Art Group, that they insisted on calling The Blake-ists! (my surname then, maiden name). Our group of 11 artists held a successful exhibition, Coast at The Queen's Hotel, in Penzance (see newspaper article attached for further details). Other exhibitions I organised were at the Hypatia Trust and various local Arts and Crafts Fairs.</p>

    <h3>The Armada Project</h3>

    <p>In 2008, I got an amazing commission to paint on The Armada Project for the House of Lords. Following my interview, I was invited to join a team of artists to paint under the guidance of Anthony Oakshett, an amazing London oil painter. I was thrilled to have this incredible opportunity, as it was a dream come true, to work with such a talented painter!</p>

    <p>The commission produced five large canvases, each 12ft by 14ft, depicting England's victory over the Spanish fleets as they progress up the English Channel. I painted the background layers of Image 1 below, see photograph of me painting the first layer at the Wrest Park studio! I learnt loads about the fine art of oil painting, in layers to create depth. These paintings are on permanent display in the Princes Chamber at the House of Lords. Following this exciting work I moved to London permanently, to be nearer family.</p>

    <h3>New Directions</h3>

    <p>Once moved, I continued teaching at both primary and secondary schools and exhibited regularly at Art Fairs (see exhibitions list). I created still lives, landscapes and interiors as well as commissioned portraits and figurative pieces. I sold originals and started working on a collection of paintings for print.</p>

    <p>Following a difficult family situation in 2009, I started training as a holistic therapist and Reiki Master, at Beyond Reiki, the holistic development and healing practice in South West London. This healing work has influenced the subject and direction of my artwork. I find painting to be a magical process of creation and reflection.</p>

    <p>I enjoy the challenge of allowing the painting to unfold and intuition to guide me. Most of my paintings do not have a fixed definite outcome at the start. This process of creating, transforms my relationship with the subject and I hope will help others too. In making, each image develops as an icon, the subject and scene develop together in a transformational process.</p>

    <p>I work in a range of media, chosen to suit the subject matter. For example the original Blue Whale painting is a watercolour, however, the majority of my work is painted in mixed media and finished in oils.</p>
