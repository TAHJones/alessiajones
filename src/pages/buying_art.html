      <h3>Buying Prints</h3>

      <p>Limited edition archival quality prints are available to order, in a range of sizes. All of these sizes are to scale of the original’s proportions and will have additional paper, surrounding each print, for mounting and framing purposes. If you have specific requirements in this regard, please specify at the time of making your order.</p>

      <p>Alessia Jones will personally oversee the Glicée printing process, to ensure high resolution quality prints and accurate colour matching. All prints are numbered and signed by the artist and sold unframed.</p>
